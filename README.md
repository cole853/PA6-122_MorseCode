# PA6-122_MorseCode
A binary search tree project that converts English into Morse code for CPTS 122 programming assignment 6. Completed on 3/22/2021.

This program reads from the MorseTable.txt file and creates a node for each letter containing the letter and its Morse code string. English letters are read from the Convert.txt file and printed to the terminal as Morse code.

# Seven Files Are Required:

BSTNode.h: contains the BSTNode class which has a letter, the Morse code string corresponding to the letter, and pointers to the left and right nodes.

BSTNode.cpp: contains the definitions for BSTNode class functions.

BST.h: contains the BST class where the BST is formed and text in Convert.txt is printed to the terminal as Morse code.

BST.cpp: contains the definitions for BST class functions.

main.cpp: contains the main function for the program where BST.printResult() is called.

MorseTable.txt: contains characters with their corresponding Morse code strings.

Convert.txt: contains the letters and characters to be converted into Morse code.

# Possible Improvments 

More characters could be added to the Morse code BST.
